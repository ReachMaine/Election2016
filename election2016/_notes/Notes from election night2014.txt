Notes from election night
---------------------------
1. if only one person running, dont put % of voters
2. 3 precincts reporting, voter turnout 2%.  (need to look at that calculation)
3. if < n number of results, dont need totals at top & bottom.
4. Autorefresh?
5. Check back for live results, link to elections page, link getting stripped out.
6. Multiple people putting results in and/or entertaining reports & publisher.
7.  Broadcasting troubles (see Cyndi)
