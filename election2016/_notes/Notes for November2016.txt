Things to consider/work on.
1.  if nothing counted, show image or show image + blank totals??? (watch div by zero)

2.  Names of races in DB
           i.e. use 'Legislative District 135' ....and NOT: Representative To The Legislature District 135 (D)
		   
3.  escape html characters in names like:  Moira O'Neil a/o Swan's Island

4.  separating out the town info from the spreadsheet - registeredvoters, r_d, r_r, r_g, r_u.  

5.  WISHLIST: widget with DDL to pick race to show summary results (for sidebar)?

6.  multiple races on a page (need Unique ID for javascript, i suspect)

7.  REPORTED Condition check:  if not reported condition  (reported != 1) or if reported (reported == 1)

8.  SQL Escape stuff.

9.  Options on shortcodes:  show title of race?, show image if no results yet?

10. Some races we WONT have all the results.  Cant assume winner (ex.  District 6, most of which is in Washington county.)

11. need a page that has all the towns & if they have reported at all.

12.  For Primary, if contested need different colors for pie charts.

13.  Check ALL conditions for reported!!!!
