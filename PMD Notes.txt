Notes
- order candidates as well as races on input form (same as ballots coming)
- make sure reported is a boolean & test as boolean.
- how to show town counsel where top 3 of 4 win. (bar might work)
- simplepie:  check for only one race OR only one candidate to not show.

Chart Notes
 - height of bars2
 - bar chart proportions.
 - simplepie width s.t. we can put inside stories. (min-width?)
 - space after pie & before pie2


Geeky stuff.
 - make plug s.t. one code base
 	with defaults for unofficial text & partial text.
 	loading google charts init out of header 
 	css for it contained in one place.
 - make race one function with inputs
	that builds the piedata, but different outputs.
